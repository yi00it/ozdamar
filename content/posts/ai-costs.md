You know, I'm starting to think that AI might just leave me penniless. Why? Because I'm paying OpenAI, I'm paying Claude, and now Google's getting in on the advanced AI game too. I used to pay for Midjourney as well. I'm using these services so heavily, constantly trying things out, that I'm not sure if there's any end in sight. It's amazing, but I think I'm starting to worry a little about my budget. Hopefully, over time these tools get cheaper and we can do even cooler things with more tokens without breaking the bank.
