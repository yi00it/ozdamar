# Simple Todo App

A minimalist todo application that demonstrates clean code principles and modern JavaScript.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Filter by status (all, active, completed)
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Responsive design

## Technology

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. No frameworks required!

## What I Learned

This project taught me the importance of keeping things simple and not over-engineering solutions. Sometimes vanilla JavaScript is all you need.
